The objective of the dietary interview component is to obtain detailed dietary intake information from NHANES participants. 
The dietary intake data are used to estimate the types and amounts of foods and beverages (including all types of water)
consumed during the 24-hour period prior to the interview (midnight to midnight), and to estimate intakes of energy, 
nutrients, and other food components from those foods and beverages. 
Following the dietary recall, participants are asked questions on salt use, 
whether the person's overall intake on the previous day was much more than usual, usual or much less than usual,
 and whether the respondent is on any type of special diet.
Questions on frequency of fish and shellfish consumed during the past 30 days were asked of survey participants 1 year or older, with the use of proxies for young children.
The dietary interview component, called What We Eat in America (WWEIA), is conducted as a partnership between the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).
Under this partnership, DHHS' National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) is responsible for the survey sample design and all aspects of data collection 
and USDA's Food Surveys Research Group (FSRG) is responsible for the dietary data collection methodology,
maintenance of the databases used to code and process the data, and data review and processing.
All NHANES participant are eligible for two 24-hour dietary recall interviews. 
The first dietary recall interview is collected in-person in the Mobile Examination Center (MEC) and the second interview is collected by telephone 3 to 10 days later.
As in previous years, two types of dietary intake data are available for the 2011-2012 survey cycle: Individual Foods files and Total Nutrient Intakes files.
","NHANES Two Day Consumption is set up to meet Creme Food model needs.
From the DR1IFF take all the consumption events where  DRDINT=2 and merge with the consumption events from DR2IFF where DRDINT=2
